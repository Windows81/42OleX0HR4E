I've run a Python program that generates a text file that works with FFMPEG's concat format.  Then, I use a downloaded MP4 video stream from Cary Teaches You How to Time Travel to perform time-travel at a 0.5 random chance.  The video in question was modified to include H264 keyframes every 0.1 seconds.

You can watch the livestream [here](https://archive.org/details/youtube-z1A6vIag8eA).
